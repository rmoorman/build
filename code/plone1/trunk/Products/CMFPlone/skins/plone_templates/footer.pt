     Please keep the Plone Powered button (or a textual link to us) if you use
     Plone on your site. It's a nice token of gratitude, and we appreciate your
     help in promoting the Plone name.

     Plone is powered by the combined forces of Zope and CMF, two absolutely
     great systems made by Zope Corporation (http://zope.com) and they in turn
     are based on the best programming language in the world - Python
     (http://www.python.org). We owe these guys a lot, thanks for making Plone
     possible!

If you can read this text, it means you are not experiencing the Plone design at its best.
Plone makes heavy use of CSS, which means it is accessible to any internet browser,
but the design needs a
<a href="http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/">standards-compliant browser to look like we intended it</a>.
Just so you know ;)
