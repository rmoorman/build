Formulator Field - Test

  Description

    With the 'test' view, you can test the look and feel and
    validation behavior of the field. Fill in the field and press the
    'Test' button to test it.

    You will now see the test form again. If your input was
    successfully validated by the field, you will see a message 'Test
    successful:' above the test form, followed by the result of the
    validation processing (this may be empty text in case you filled
    in nothing).

    If the field could not be validated, you will see the message 'There was a
    validation error:' instead, followed by a description of the error:

      * 'field_id' gives the field name.

      * 'error_key' is the name of the error message; you can find it
         in the 'messages' tab.

      * 'error_text' is the actual text associated with the
        'error_key'; you can modify it in the 'messages' tab.
