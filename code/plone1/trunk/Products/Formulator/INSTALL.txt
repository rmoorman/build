  Requirements

    Formulator should work with Zope versions 2.10 or higher:

      http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope

  Upgrading

    to 1.11 from earlier versions

      Five 1.2 is needed to make i18n work. Alternatively remove the
      file `configure.zcml` from the Formulator directory -- this is
      safe and just removes the i18n support.

    to 1.9 from 1.8

      There should be no problems.

    to 1.8 from 1.7

      Note that the i18n-features added in 1.7
      have been cut down a little; if You have relied on
      Formulator to do the translations automagically in 1.7
      You might need to add a few i18n-statements to Your
      form rendering template to get the translations working with 1.8 

    to 1.6.x from earlier versions

      There should be no problems.

    to 1.6.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems.

    to 1.4.2 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems.

    to 1.4.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems.

    to 1.4.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems.

    to 1.3.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems (see note for 0.9.2 though in the
      unusual case you're upgrading from that..this is the last time
      I'll mention it :).

    to 1.3.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems, but see the note if you're
      upgrading from 0.9.2 or below (but I'd be surprised if you
      were!).

    to 1.2.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems, but see the note if you're upgrading
      from version 0.9.2 or below.

    to 1.1.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or
      below however, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3. Do note
      that the Override tab is scheduled to be phased out eventually in
      favor of the TALES tab. This will take a while yet, though.

    to 1.0.9 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or
      below however, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3. Do note
      that the Override tab is scheduled to be phased out eventually in
      favor of the TALES tab. This will take a while yet, though.

    to 1.0.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or
      below, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3.

    to 1.0 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems. If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or
      below, please see the upgrading note for 0.9.3.

    to 0.9.5 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems in upgrading from 0.9.4 or 0.9.3.
      If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or below, see the upgrading note
      for 0.9.3.

    to 0.9.4 from earlier versions

      There should be no problems in upgrading from 0.9.3.

      If you're upgrading from 0.9.2 or below, see the upgrading
      note for 0.9.3.

    to 0.9.3 from earlier versions

      'items_method' in ListField is gone; you'll have to adjust make
      your forms use 'items' in the override tab now instead. Sorry
      about that, it *was* marked experimental. :)

      There should be no other problems in upgrading.

    to 0.9.2 from earlier versions

      There should be no significant upgrade problems; your forms
      should still work. RangedIntegerFields should show up as
      IntegerFields, which subsume their functionality.

    to 0.9.1 from earlier versions

      There should be no significant upgrade problems; your forms
      should still work.

  Quickstart

    Formulator follows the normal Zope filesystem product installation
    procedure; just unpack the tarball to your products directory and
    restart Zope.

    Now the same at a more leisurely pace.

  Unpacking

    Formulator comes as a 'Formulator-x.x.tgz' file, where 'x.x'
    stands for the Formulator version number. On Unix, you can use::

      tar xvzf Formulator-x.x.tgz

    to unpack the file. On Windows you can use your favorite archiving
    software, such as WinZip.

    This will create a Formulator directory.

  Installing the Product

    Move this directory to your Zope's Products directory. Normally
    this is 'yourzope/lib/python/Products'.

    Now restart your Zope.

  Verifying Installation

    If all went well, Formulator should now be visible in Zope in the
    Products screen ('/Control_Panel/Products'). In a Zope folder, you
    should now see a 'Formulator Form' in your 'Add' list. You should
    be able to add a form to a folder now.
