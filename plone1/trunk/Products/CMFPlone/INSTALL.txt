For nicer install docs, try http://plone.org/documentation. They are more up to
date, and have nice and funky pictures to go with them ;)

**Download the following:**

- "Latest Zope":http://www.zope.org/Products (you need at least version  2.5.1)

- "Latest CMF":http://cmf.zope.org/download (you need at least version 1.3)

- "Latest Plone":http://plone.org/download

  - Plone comes with 3 Products that need to be installed in the Products 
    directory: CMFPlone, DCWorkflow and Formulator.

  - If you are using Zope 2.5.1, you will also need to download ActivePak from
       http://plone.org/download and put it in your Products directory.  DO NOT
       INSTALL ActivePak if you are using Zope 2.6+

**The installation procedure:**

- Install Zope (2.5.1 or later)

- Unpack the CMF directories (CMFCore, CMFDefault etc) into your Products 
  directory (CMF1.3 or later)

- Unpack the Plone directory (CMFPlone) into your Products directory 
  (also include the DCWorkflow and Formulator products as well as ActivePak
  if you are using Zope 2.5.1 -- DO NOT USE ActivePak with Zope 2.6+)

- Start Zope

- From /manage interface there should be a 'Select Type to Add' that says
  Plone Site.  click on that, fill in information and voilá!

- This means that installation of Plone was successful. Go to the front page, 
  and have a look at your new Plone site.

- If you want to set up translations for your Plone site, there is documentation
  available on plone.org in the Development section. Plone comes with a lot of
  language files, have a look in the i18n directory.

- Have fun, and don't forget to report any bugs or inconsistencies in the 
  "Plone Collector":http://plone.org 

Thank you for helping us improve Plone!
