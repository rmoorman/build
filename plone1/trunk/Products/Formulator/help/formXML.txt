Formulator Form - XML

  Description

    In this view, you can see an XML serialization of the form. If you
    are using FSForm along with FileSystemSite, you can use this XML
    by putting it on the filesystem as a .form file. FileSystemSite
    will then pick it up and reflect it into the ZODB. This way you
    can develop and maintain Formulator Forms on the filesystem.

    FileSystemSite can be found here:

      http://www.zope.org/Members/k_vertigo/Products/FileSystemSite

    To enable Formulator support for FileSystemSite, do a 'from
    Products.Formulator import FSForm' somewhere in your own code (for
    instance in your product's '__init__.py').
