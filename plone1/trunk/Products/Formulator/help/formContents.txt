Formulator Form - Contents

  Description

    The contents view of a Formulator Form behaves much like normal
    Zope Folder. The difference is that the only objects listed are
    Formulator Fields, and if you look at the 'Add' list you can see
    you can only add different types of fields on this screen.

    Similarly, you can't copy and paste objects into the form that are
    not fields, and it is not allowed to copy fields to normal folders
    either.

    If you click on a field, you will enter the field edit screen, where
    you can modify field properties.

  Other Help

    The other tabs of the Formulator Form contain their own help text;
    fields also provide help.

    Formulator Form, look at the online help for Folders.
