Formulator Form - Settings

  Description

    You can set some basic settings of the form.

  Number of groups in row (in order tab)

    Change the amount of groups that should appear in a single row
    in the 'order' view. The default is '4'.

  Form action

    The method the form should call when it is submitted. If you use
    the 'header()' method of Form, it will use this as the 'action'
    attribute of the HTML form.

  Form method

    The submit method of the form (not to be confused with a method in
    Python of Zope). 'POST' is generally used for forms that change
    underlying data, while 'GET' is generally used for forms that do a
    query. In case of 'GET' the fields in the form will be encoded in
    the URL (so you can for instance bookmark the URL). The 'header()'
    method of the Form will use this as the 'method' attribute of the
    HTML form.

  Form enctype

    The encoding type of the form. If no encoding type is selected,
    the default for HTML will be used, which is
    'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. No enctype is therefore
    usually just fine. For forms that allow the uploading of a file,
    use 'multipart/form-data'. The 'header()' method of the Form will
    use this as the 'enctype' attribute of the HTML form.

  Upgrade

    The 'Upgrade' button in this section is really not useful yet.
    It's used internally to upgrade unreleased development versions of
    Formulator to the current version. Perhaps this will become more
    useful in the future.
